## Last Week's Accomplishments


Started on implementing the TA grading panel. I had no idea where/how the current Instructor grading panel was implemented
so I started taking a look at the codebase and poking around before writing any code..

## This Week's Plan

Continue work on the TA grading panel, hopefully create a new tab for TAs to use to grade and show what classes they're TAing for.
I also need to get more acclimated with the codebase, as this is an incredibly big project and I've never worked on something
this big, so it is hard for me to find the relevant information and code.

## Anything Blocking?

Need to learn more Angular, get accustomed the codebase.
