## Last Week's Accomplishments

After using git stash quite frequently the past week, I accidentally lost all my changes from the past
2 or 3 weeks when I was switching branches locally, setting me back a bit. I had to figure out
some of the changes I lost, such as my changes to the submissions model and the addition of the
TA panel to the student page, and reimplement them.

## This Week's Plan
Figure out what else I implemented in the past that I lost so I can do it again.
I also learned that I should commit and push a lot more often than I have been doing in the past
so that this does not happen again. This coming week is the last one of the semester, so I want
to be at least 85% done with implementing the TA grading panel. I am going to go through 
all of the models, as most of them do not account for TAs, and add appropriate code there.

## Notes
As I said at the beginning, I lost a lot of my progress that I did over the past month. I hope this doesn't
reflect poorly and make it seem as if I did not do a lot of work, as I did make a decent amount of changes
that I lost because of a simple mistake on my end.
