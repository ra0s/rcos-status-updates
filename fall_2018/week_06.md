## Last Week's Accomplishments


I was very busy with numerous tests and personal things last week,
so I did not get anything done.

## This Week's Plan
Try to get the grading page working. I was originally implementing it as a page
within the student "tab" because a TA is also a student, but Varun suggested I try
a different method to get around some of the difficulty I'd been facing.

## Anything Blocking?
I'm not really sure how to add completely new endpoints (ie a TA endpoint) for 
the application, so I need to learn more about how to do that especially in a 
project this big.
