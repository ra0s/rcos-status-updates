## Last Week's Accomplishments


I was very busy with numerous tests and personal things last week,
so I did not get anything done.

## This Week's Plan
Try to get the grading page working, I changed the implementation personal
Varun's recommendation so I'm trying it from a different angle this time.

## Anything Blocking?
I'm not really sure how to add completely new endpoints (ie a TA endpoint) for 
the application, so I need to learn more about how to do that especially in a 
project this big.
