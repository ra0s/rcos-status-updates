## Last Week's Accomplishments

I made a lot of progress after reverting back to a previous commit. 
I went into the submissions model, adding a method that could recognize if the 
student was a TA and then returning any data related to them. I also went into the 
sections model and did the same thing.

## This Week's Plan
Keep working on retrieving the proper submissions from the TA side, as we are
currently not getting the right submissions. I need to go into the models and
controllers for anything related to submissions and classes as none of them
have any authentication for TAs yet.

## Anything Blocking?
Lots of tests and final projects
