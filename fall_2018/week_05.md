## Last Week's Accomplishments

I added a page for grading by using the authentication to check if a person is a student/TA/instructor.
If they are confirmed to be a TA, they will see a tab on their navbar for grading.
Currently the grading page does not do anything.

I also made the authentication that checks if someone is a student more robust because
the code was sometimes having a hard time distinguishing the difference between a student
and a TA - as technically a student can be a TA, TAing for a class while also
being enrolled in their own courses.

## This Week's Plan
Show student submissions on the grading page so the TA can grade it
## Anything Blocking?
Like last week, there is old code that seems to not be working. My current workaround
is to modify the seed data myself, but that will not work when the project is live.
