## Last Week's Accomplishments


Got authorization working to check if someone is a TA

## This Week's Plan

Continue work on the TA grading panel, hopefully create a new tab for TAs to use to grade and show what classes they're TAing for.

## Anything Blocking?

Past code that would update TA users does not seem to be working
## Notes
